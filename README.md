I present You one of my commercial project for phillipino restaurant call Pizza Streat. I was asked to design and develop front-end side of the web-page. Since I was looking for new projects to improve and check myself in building websites from scratch, I was really excited to get my hands dirty on that project and I accepted the challenge.

Used technologies:
-HTML5,
-CSS3,
-SASS,
-JAVASCRIPT,
-REACT,
-REACT ROUTER,
-NPM PACKAGE,
-NODE.JS and EXPRESS(for starting up server on heroku)

Project is still in process of developing and improving. Mostly I still willing to improve the RWD. Also in the near future I am planning to wire up contact form using AWS Lambda function. Next, I will add more sections when I will get soon more information from my client.
